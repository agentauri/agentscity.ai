# Scarcity Test Experiment
# Tests how agents behave under resource scarcity conditions

name: "Resource Scarcity Comparison"
description: |
  Compares agent behavior under normal vs scarce resource conditions.
  Measures survival rates, cooperation, and economic inequality.

hypothesis: |
  Under scarcity, agents will show higher conflict rates but also
  develop more sophisticated cooperation strategies for survival.
