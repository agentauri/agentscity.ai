# LLM Model Comparison Experiment
# Compares different LLM models in identical conditions

name: "LLM Model Behavioral Comparison"
description: |
  Isolates each LLM type to measure model-specific behaviors.
  Each variant runs with 6 agents of a single LLM type.

hypothesis: |
  Different LLM models will exhibit distinct behavioral patterns,
  with some showing more cooperative tendencies and others more
  competitive or exploitative strategies.
